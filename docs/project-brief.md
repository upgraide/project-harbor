# Project Brief: Harbor Partners Investment Platform

## Executive Summary

Harbor Partners Investment Platform is a comprehensive digital ecosystem that transforms how investment opportunities are presented, managed, and tracked. The platform consists of an exclusive investor portal where pre-qualified investors access curated investment opportunities matched to their profiles, and a powerful backoffice system with integrated CRM capabilities for Harbor Partners' team to manage the entire investment lifecycle.

The platform addresses Harbor Partners' critical need to scale beyond manual processes while maintaining the confidentiality and personalized service their 500+ high-value investors expect. By automating opportunity-investor matching, document distribution, NDA management, and commission tracking, the platform positions Harbor Partners as a premium digital-first investment partner.

The key value proposition centers on exclusive access, intelligent matching, and streamlined decision-making—allowing investors to quickly evaluate opportunities while Harbor Partners maintains full visibility into investor engagement and deal pipeline metrics.

## Problem Statement

Harbor Partners currently relies on manual, unscalable processes—email, phone calls, and direct communication—to share investment opportunities with their 500+ investor network. This creates critical operational bottlenecks: inability to scale operations, lack of visibility into investor engagement, inefficient opportunity-investor matching, manual document distribution, and time-consuming administrative tasks that prevent the team from focusing on high-value activities.

The absence of a centralized platform means opportunities may be missed due to communication delays, investors lack a professional portal to review deals at their convenience, compliance and NDA tracking is manual and error-prone, and there's no systematic way to analyze investor behavior or optimize deal flow. 

Without digital transformation, Harbor Partners risks losing competitive advantage to tech-enabled investment firms, cannot efficiently scale beyond current volumes, and may miss valuable co-investment opportunities due to process friction. The manual commission tracking also creates potential for errors and disputes, while the lack of integrated CRM functionality means the sales pipeline and client relationships are managed in disconnected systems.

The urgency is driven by market expectations for digital-first experiences, the need to handle growing deal volume without proportionally increasing headcount, and the October 2025 timeline to establish Harbor Partners as the premium digital investment partner in their market.

## Proposed Solution

The Harbor Partners Investment Platform is a unified web application that digitizes and streamlines the entire investment opportunity lifecycle. The solution features a dual-interface architecture: an exclusive investor portal for opportunity discovery and engagement, and a comprehensive backoffice with integrated CRM for the Harbor Partners team.

The investor portal provides secure, personalized access where each investor sees only opportunities matching their profile (asset type, geography, investment capacity). Investors can review detailed opportunity information, access documents through OneDrive integration, and express interest via "Co-Invest" or "Become Lead Investor" actions that trigger automated NDA workflows through Box Sign integration.

The backoffice empowers Harbor Partners' team with complete operational control: dynamic opportunity management with customizable fields for M&A and Real Estate deals, intelligent investor-opportunity matching based on configurable criteria, integrated CRM for managing the full sales cycle from lead to close, automated commission calculation and tracking, and comprehensive analytics dashboards showing KPIs, deal pipeline, and investor engagement metrics.

This solution transforms Harbor Partners from a manual operation to a scalable, data-driven investment platform while maintaining the exclusivity and personalized service their investors value. The platform's flexibility through customizable fields and matching criteria ensures it can evolve with Harbor Partners' business without requiring fundamental restructuring.

## Target Users

### Primary User Segment: High-Value Investors

Harbor Partners serves a diverse ecosystem of 500+ sophisticated investors including High Net Worth Individuals (HNWIs), institutional investors, family offices, and corporate investors. These users require exclusive access to pre-vetted investment opportunities, expect professional-grade analysis tools and documentation, value confidentiality and discretion in their investment activities, and need efficient evaluation processes to make timely investment decisions.

Their current workflow involves receiving opportunities via email or phone, manually reviewing documents, expressing interest through informal channels, and lacking visibility into deal progress. The platform will transform this experience by providing 24/7 access to matched opportunities, structured evaluation workflows, and clear engagement paths.

### Secondary User Segment: Harbor Partners Team

The Harbor Partners team consists of 10 key members with distinct roles: 4 Administrators (Gonçalo Almeida, João Diogo Vieira, João Mota, Rodrigo Almeida) who oversee operations and commission structures, and 6 Team Members who manage client relationships and deal execution. 

Each team member currently juggles multiple responsibilities across client acquisition, client management, investor sourcing, investor relations, and deal execution—all tracked through manual processes. The platform will provide role-based access with commission visibility for admins, unified workspace for opportunity and investor management, automated workflows for routine tasks, and real-time visibility into pipeline and performance metrics.

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **PM & Rodrigo Coordination Meeting** - Define comprehensive list of validation questions for client meeting
2. **Client Validation Meeting** - Present questions and gather all remaining requirements
3. **Design Phase** - Create mockups and wireframes based on validated requirements
4. **Client Review of Mockups** - Validate all designs before development begins
5. **PRD Finalization** - Update PRD based on client feedback and approved designs
6. **Obtain API Credentials** - OneDrive and Box Sign access for integration testing
7. **Development Environment Setup** - Only after full client validation
8. **Begin Development** - Start implementation with validated requirements and approved designs

### Critical Path
**No development work should begin until:**
- All validation questions are answered by Harbor Partners
- Mockups are created and approved by the client
- PRD is finalized with validated requirements
- Technical architecture is reviewed and approved

### PM Handoff
This Project Brief provides the foundational context for the Harbor Partners Investment Platform. Your immediate priority is to work with Rodrigo to create a comprehensive list of validation questions that need answers from Harbor Partners before any development begins.

**Your First Task:**
Work with Rodrigo to identify all areas in this brief that need client validation, particularly:
- Specific user workflows and edge cases
- Detailed business rules for commission calculations
- Exact NDA flow and document access tiers
- CRM pipeline stages and customization needs
- Email notification triggers and templates
- Analytics and reporting priorities
- Role-based permissions details
- Data migration approach

Once you have the validation questions list, schedule the client meeting. After receiving answers, work with the designer to create mockups that Rodrigo can use for client validation. Only after full client approval should the PRD be finalized and development begin. This validation-first approach is critical for meeting the October 2025 deadline without costly rework.
